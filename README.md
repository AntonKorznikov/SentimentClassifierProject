# SentimentClassifierProject

This repository contains the project of Team 7 for the course Software Engineering for AI at Skoltech 2024. 

This project features a pipeline that takes text as input and provides information about its sentiment.
The model uses a pre-trained transformer encoder from HuggingFace.

# How to run 
1.  Build the image (in the project directory) by: docker build -t fse_project . It will take a lot of time!!!
2.  Run the container by: docker run -it fse_project
